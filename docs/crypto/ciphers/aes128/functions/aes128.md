# Function: aes128()

> **aes128**(`key`): [`Cipher`](../../../types/interfaces/Cipher.md)

Creates an AES-128-CBC cipher for PDF encryption.
The cipher prepends a random IV to encrypted data during encryption
and extracts the IV from the first 16 bytes during decryption.

## Parameters

### key

[`ByteArray`](../../../../types/type-aliases/ByteArray.md)

The 16-byte encryption key.

## Returns

[`Cipher`](../../../types/interfaces/Cipher.md)

A Cipher object with encrypt and decrypt methods.

## Throws

Error if the key is not exactly 16 bytes.

## Example

```typescript
const cipher = aes128(key)
const encrypted = await cipher.encrypt(plaintext)
const decrypted = await cipher.decrypt(encrypted)
```
